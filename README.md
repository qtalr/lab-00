## Objectives
    
- Access a lab activity
- Create and edit a Quarto document and render a report
- Export a report as a PDF or Word document
- Learn the submission process on Canvas

## Instructions

### Getting started

1. Create a Quarto document using the RStudio toolbar
  - Provide the title: "Literate Programming I"
  - Provide the author: \<Your Name\>
2. Render the Quarto document (without changes)
  - Click the 'Knit' button on the RStudio toolbar
  - Save the Quarto file with the name `lab-0.qmd`.

### Exploring Quarto

1. In your own words describe:

- What is Literate Programming?
- What is Quarto?

In your descriptions use various [options provided by the basic Markdown syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) to format your response (i.e. headers, bold, italics, lists, links, *etc*.)

*Remember: you can preview your work at any time by clicking the 'Knit' button in the RStudio toolbar*

2. Render the `.qmd` as a PDF or a Word document
  - Use the dropdown arrow to the right of the 'Knit' button and select either 'Knit to PDF' or 'Knit to Word'

3. (optional) Explore adding a code chunk and some R code to your R Markdown document
  - You can copy and paste code from Recipe #1 to get you started.
  - Try and manipulate the code chunk options (i.e. hiding code and/ or output), for example.

### Assessing your progress

1. Add a section which describes your learning in this lab

Some questions to consider: 

  - What did you learn?
  - What was most/ least challenging?
  - What resources did you consult? Instructor? Websites (provide links)?
  - What more would you like to know about literate programming and/ or Quarto?

## Submission for feedback

1. To prepare your lab report for submission on Canvas you will need to Knit your R Markdown document to PDF or Word. 
2. Download this file to your computer.
3. Go to the Canvas submission page for Lab #0 and submit your PDF/Word document as a 'File Upload'. Add any comments you would like to pass on to me about the lab in the 'Comments...' box in Canvas.
