- Access a lab activity
- Create, edit, and export a Quarto document as a report
- Demonstrate your ability to use some of the basic Markdown syntax
- Learn the submission process on Canvas

## Instructions

### Getting started

1. Create a Quarto document using the RStudio toolbar
  - Provide the title: "Lab 0: writing with code"
  - Provide the author: \<Your Name\>
2. Render the Quarto document (without changes)
  - Click the 'Render' button on the RStudio toolbar
  - Save the Quarto file with the name `lab-0.qmd`.

### Exploring Quarto

1. In your own words, respond to the following questions in your `.qmd` document:

- What is Literate Programming?
- What is Quarto?

In your responses use various [options provided by the basic Markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) to format your response (i.e. headers, bold, italics, lists, links, *etc*.)

*Remember: you can preview your work at any time by clicking the 'Render' button in the RStudio toolbar*

2. Render the `.qmd` as a PDF or a Word document
  - Use update the key atrribute `format:` to have either the value `pdf` or `docx`

3. (optional) Explore adding a code block and some R code to your R Markdown document
  - You can copy and paste code from Recipe #0 to get you started.
  - Try and manipulate the code block options (i.e. hiding code and/ or output), for example.
